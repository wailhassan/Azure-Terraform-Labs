## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wailhassan/Azure-Terraform-Labs.git
   cd Azure-Terraform-Labs
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Lab Directory**

   Each lab is contained within its own directory. For example:

   ```bash
   cd "1. Manages a Resource Group"
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Review and Apply the Configuration**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

   *Note: Always review the Terraform plan before applying changes to understand what resources will be created or modified.*

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove the resources created during a lab:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

*Ensure you're in the correct lab directory before running the destroy command to avoid unintended deletions.*
